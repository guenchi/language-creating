# Phonology 

### Vowels:

![img](https://github.com/guenchi/language-creating/blob/master/img/cl0.png)

This language has only five vowels: / ɑ /, / ɛ/, / ɪ /, / o /, / u /.


1. / ɪ / only comes after / kʰ /, / pʰ /, / tʰ/, / n /, / ŋ /.

2. [ ɤ ] is the variant  of / ɛ / when it comes before / ŋ /.

3. [ a ] is the variant  of / ɑ / when it comes after / j / .

### Consonants:

1. Fortis-lenis pairs:

These pairs of consonants distinguish themselves by whether they are aspired or not instead of whether they are voiced or not.

/p/ = [ pʰ ] or [ bʰ ]            /b/ = [ p ] or [ b ]

/t/ = [ tʰ ] or [ dʰ ]              /d / = [ t ] or [ d ]

/k/ = [ kʰ ] or [ gʰ ]            /g/ = [ k ] or [ g ]

2. / z / /m/ /b/ almost happen in the non-stressed syllables.

3. The germination will almost happen when / s / is in the stressed syllable.

This language does not have a writing system. Here we spell it by Latin characters.
